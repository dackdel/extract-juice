Aker has established Seetee, a new company with a capitalisation of NOK 500 million, to invest in projects and companies within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Seetee's strategy is to use Bitcoin as its treasury asset, establish mining operations, and build and invest in projects and companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Aker hopes that Seetee will help them stay innovative and keep up with the times.

Seetee is an open invitation to challenge the status quo and act like young entrepreneurs. Akers' decision to invest in Bitcoin is the result of a long discussion about value. This letter is a way of expressing thoughts on the matter, which were derived from reading articles, listening to podcasts, and conversations with people. Bitcoin has inspired us to challenge our understanding of money, and Seetee has formed a partnership with Blockstream, a leader in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The riskiest decision is not investing, as central bankers have agreed to target two percent inflation, which implies that one third of money is taxed away every twenty years. Real estate can be priced in gold to demonstrate this effect.

In 2004, Norges Bank sold its last gold reserves citing poor historical returns, yet U.S. residential real estate prices are among the lowest they have been in the last hundred years when measured in gold. In 2018, the #GetOZero hashtag started to circulate, arguing that it may be irresponsible not to include some exposure to Bitcoin given its asymmetric return properties. A young fisherman in the Northwest, far away from his native Norway, was taught the importance of scrutiny and diversification by five catholic priests. He still stands by his younger self that if you're certain about something, it pays off to focus and invest everything you have in it, but with the pandemic, he has come to understand the importance of diversification. He now responds to challenges with a tad bit more risk management and academic rigour.

Bitcoin has been around for more than a decade and has been met with skepticism due to its electricity consumption, scalability, and anonymity. However, its value has grown as more people believe in it, and it has the potential to become engrained in the social fabric. It can also be used to enable applications that create tremendous value, and its energy consumption can be used to power renewable sources. Banks are government regulated custodians, but Bitcoin has solved the trust problem in a way that two parties can transact without a third party.

Bitcoin is a mechanism that allows people to transact without verifying and trusting each other, eliminating the need for a third party like a bank. Miners use electricity to be compensated with bitcoins, and this economic battery can optimize local supply and demand for electricity, potentially accelerating the energy transition. Bitcoin's electricity consumption can be analyzed with respect to future scenarios for the network, and if it replaces gold as an asset class, its scarcity would be sufficient and its environmental price would be much lower than gold's.

Bitcoin has the potential to provide economic access to the unbanked, facilitate micropayments, and disrupt compliance. Its electricity consumption is only viable if the value created by the network is sufficient, and scalability is achieved by making slight trade-offs without compromising its open and secure nature.

Bitcoin transactions take about ten minutes to be confirmed and can process seven transactions per second. The Lightning Network is built on top of Bitcoin to make it scale, allowing transactions to complete in milliseconds and process millions per second with hardly any use of electricity. This creates the possibility of programmable microtransactions and a payment stream that can unlock limitless opportunities. Bitcoin can scale brilliantly in layers upon layers that make trade-offs applicable to particular applications. Though criminals were the first to take advantage of Bitcoin's potential, its use for illegal activities is minuscule. The libertarian ideals of the cypherpunk movement hold promise and valuable ideas for the world today.

In her book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff exposes how internet behemoths have turned us into the product. Bitcoin Lightning wallets may enable instant credit without the need to offer personal information, and may also enable more sophisticated KYC and AML procedures. The current system does not work for everyone, and Bitcoin may provide access to those who are unbanked. Howard Hughes' movie Hells Angels was delayed due to lack of clouds, and the reference point matters for perspective. Progress is inevitable, and Nixon's abandonment of the gold standard in 1971 changed the world fundamentally.

Rates have spiked and fallen, causing a forty year bull market for bonds. The US has taken on significant debt and pension liabilities, and global challenges such as rising inequality and climate change require more debt to fund. Gold and Bitcoin are seen as safe investments, as they are scarce, durable, portable, fungible, and divisible. Wells Fargo was founded in 1852 and used stagecoaches to transport valuables. Governments may try to ban Bitcoin, but proper regulation may increase interest in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin can also improve lives by providing access to banking for billions of people.

Aker is the first major company in Scandinavia to allocate capital to Bitcoin, joining the software-eating world. The team consists of Sverke Lorgen, Snorre Lorgen, and Magnus Granath, who have been working on Bitcoin and related projects for many years. Despite the potential of Bitcoin, there is still uncertainty and volatility, and it is important to remember that there is risk in everything. Niels Bohr's quote about quantum mechanics is applicable to money, as it is constantly changing and unknowable. Aker is eager to learn more and be part of the Bitcoin community.

Seetee is a company founded by Kjell Inge Rkke and Ola Snve, which seeks to provide access to real-life industrial problems that may be difficult to access elsewhere. Last year, bitcoin made significant progress towards becoming a mainstream investment, with investors like Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller disclosing that they have significant positions. Seetee encourages entrepreneurs with knowledge about, experience with, and big ideas and ambitions for Bitcoin to reach out to them, as they are not just going to wait for the future but want to join in building it. Ola has invested a significant part of his net worth and will be Seetee's Executive Chairman.

Aker has established Seetee, a new company with a capitalisation of NOK 500 million, to invest in projects and companies within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Seetee's strategy is to use Bitcoin as its treasury asset, establish mining operations, and build and invest in projects and companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin has inspired Aker to challenge their understanding of money and its value, and Seetee has formed a partnership with Blockstream, a leader in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Bitcoin has been met with skepticism due to its electricity consumption, scalability, and anonymity, but it has the potential to become engrained in the social fabric and can be used to enable applications that create tremendous value. Bitcoin solves the trust problem in a way that two parties can transact without a third party, and its economic battery can optimize local supply and demand for electricity, potentially accelerating the energy transition.

Bitcoin has the potential to provide economic access to the unbanked, facilitate micropayments, and disrupt compliance. The Lightning Network is built on top of Bitcoin to make it scale, allowing transactions to complete in milliseconds and process millions per second. Bitcoin can also improve lives by providing access to banking for billions of people, and Aker is the first major company in Scandinavia to allocate capital to Bitcoin. Despite the potential of Bitcoin, there is still uncertainty and volatility, and it is important to remember that there is risk in everything.

Seetee is a company founded by Kjell Inge Rkke and Ola Snve that seeks to provide access to real-life industrial problems. Last year, Bitcoin made significant progress towards becoming a mainstream investment, and Seetee encourages entrepreneurs to reach out to them with knowledge, experience, and big ideas. Ola has invested a significant part of his net worth and will be Seetee's Executive Chairman.
